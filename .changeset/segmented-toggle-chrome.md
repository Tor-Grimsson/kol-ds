`SegmentedToggle` renders its real chrome again in every consumer. The container/cell look moved out of Tailwind utility classes (which never generate from package sources — consumers saw jammed labels with no border) into `.kol-seg` / `.kol-seg-cell` in kol-theme's molecule CSS, including padded cells. A11y upgrade rides along: `radiogroup`/`radio` semantics with a roving tabindex, ←→/↑↓ arrow-key selection, and a `:focus-visible` outline; new optional `ariaLabel` prop names the group. `aria-pressed` is replaced by `aria-checked`.

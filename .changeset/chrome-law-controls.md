Chrome law: every control references the Button — two variants (primary; outline = always secondary), button size scale (26/32/40). Old variant names are aliased, nothing breaks.

- **Dropdown** — trigger now emits `kol-btn kol-btn-{primary|outline} kol-btn-{size}` (fills/hover/active/focus come from the button rules; inline-style chrome removed per the theme-CSS rule). Open state is fused: primary panel continues the trigger fill (no border, no gap, hairline divider inside), outline panel carries the trigger's border. Big per-size radii (14/22/24) replaced by `--kol-radius-sm`; type pairing corrected to mono 12/14/16; chevron sizes aligned to button icon sizes. Variant aliases: `default`→primary, `subtle`→primary, `minimal`→outline.
- **Input** — `ghost` folds into `outline` (alias kept): one secondary treatment. `.kol-control--ghost` CSS retained but deprecated.
- **Textarea** — resize is real now: the `resize-grip` icon (kol-icon-set-v1) is the actual drag handle (JS corner drag, both axes, min 120×40). Native `resize` stays off — Firefox's built-in grip can't be hidden any other way, so this is the only route to one identical grip in every browser. Previously a decorative icon sat over `resize: none` — an affordance that didn't exist.
- **Input/control** — `.kol-control--outline` border moves `fg-16` → `oq-16` (opaque), matching the button outline.
- **ToggleSwitch** — rewritten: **bare by default** (label + track, no box); `primary`/`outline` shell variants at exact button geometry; new `size` prop (sm/md/lg) scales shell and track; on-state = inverted ink (matches `.kol-btn-pressed`); focus ring added; the auto-uppercase label removed (no-auto-casing rule). Aliases: `plain`→bare, `default`→outline.
